        "forum_post":"Hang in there Aeterna , you need to do each day , each hour , just one at a time. \u00a0 There's a number of threads about akathisia on this site . . . try googling \"akathisia surviving antidepressants\" and a bunch of links come up. \u00a0This is one of the more recent ones\u00a0http:\/\/survivingantidepressants.org\/index.php?\/topic\/9311-akathisia-nightmare\/ \u00a0 I agree that you should try to sit on 30mg and reassess in a couple of weeks. \u00a0If you can do this without going to hospital , you have more control over what meds you take. \u00a0 However , if you are suicidal and suspect that you may try to harm yourself , then staying at home isn't the best thing. \u00a0 Did you get any relief from the benzo you mentioned? \u00a0Have you considered a consistent dose? You're correct in thinking that many akathisia-induced suicides go unrecognized. \u00a0I can send you links to some relevant articles if you want , but at the moment they may not be helpful. \u00a0 This IS going to pass , you need to keep reminding yourself of that. \u00a0SO many people have recovered from akathisia , and you will too. \u00a0 I found it helped to do little activities so that my mind focussed on something other than the sensations. Shoulder-rolls , neck circles , colouring in shapes , cleaning the glass doors , windows , mirrors , writing affirmations over and over , listening to a speaking relaxation cd . . . make a list of things you can do. \u00a0My biggest constant panic was not knowing what to do with myself , I don't know if you have that too.",

        "forum_post":"It seems to me that the brain can only recover at a certain rate.\u00a0 Any drop below the healing rate will cause greater wd symptoms with no benefit in the rate of healing other than that you have dropped the drug so much as to maximize the rate of potential healing.\u00a0 First a person should\u00a0run a test run to determine their\u00a0rate of healing.\u00a0 If a person drops 5% and heals -has no symptoms- within 5 weeks this is a healing rate of 1% per week or (1\/7) 0.143% per day.\u00a0 Maybe there are better formulas to be established but it looks like one can avoid withdrawal symptoms by multiplying the per day healing rate by the half life of the drug to get a rate of drop per time period (half life).\u00a0 Looking at Prozac with a half-life of 6 days and slow healing rate of 0.143% per day one can drop 0.858% each 6 days without having major withdrawal symptoms.\u00a0 Of course it is near impossible to work with numbers like this so one could do 1% drop over 7 days.\u00a0 For Wellbutrin which has a half life average of say 24\u00a0hrs one can drop 0.143% per day.\u00a0 \u00a0For my 525 mg tablets this comes to 0.75075 mg drop per day (total tablet weight).\u00a0 Since of course this is almost impossible to weigh one could do a 1 mg drop every two days.\u00a0 I do not know how this would need to change down the road.\u00a0\u00a0",

I also didn't believe recovery stories.\u00a0 I would think, \"well, that is you, but I am different, I'm not going to recover and I will be sick like this for the rest of my life\"\u00a0 But its not true, I am getting better.\u00a0 I also spent months not wanting to be alive because living was like being in a nightmare through every waking moment.\u00a0 But slowly I got moments of starting to feel a little bit better.\u00a0 That gave me hope that perhaps I was able to recover. \u00a0 I didn't take anti psychotics, but I was on SSRIs for over 13 years and also a lot of other drugs which damaged my brain and nervous system.\u00a0 It doesn't matter which drug causes the damage, the recovery process is going to be the same.\u00a0 You are going to recover if you keep living, one day at a time, one moment at a time. \u00a0 I'm doing better today than I was a year ago.\u00a0 I went for a walk around a park, drove and bought some groceries, did some light exercise.\u00a0 This time last year, doing those things was close to impossible, but today it wasn't so bad. \u00a0 Hang in there, you will get through this, those windows will come if you give it more time.",

The only alternative is to try and wait out the symptoms and manage as best you can until your central nervous system returns to homeostasis. \u00a0Unfortunately no one can give you an exact timeline as to when you will start feeling better\u00a0and while some do recover relatively easily,\u00a0for others it can take longer, as you've experienced. \u00a0 Reinstatement predictably works up to 3 months after last dose. \u00a0At a year out, it's a tough call. \u00a0If you do decide to reinstate, we'd\u00a0recommend a very\u00a0small dose (more on that later). These drugs are strong, your system has become sensitized\u00a0and If you take too much it may be too much for your brain and can cause you become unstable. \u00a0Sometimes it can be hard to regain stability after this happens. \u00a0Then, once you've stabilized on that dosage, which can take several months, \u00a0you can begin a 10% per month taper down to zero. \u00a0Why taper by 10% of my dosage? \u00a0 Please read: \u00a0About reinstating and stabilizing to reduce withdrawal symptoms. -- at least the first page of the topic \u00a0 If you decide to reinstate, we'd\u00a0recommend 1mg Citalopram--definitely no more. \u00a0\u00a0It takes about 4 days for a dose change to get to get to full state in the blood and a bit longer for it to register in the brain. \u00a0Keep a daily record on how the\u00a0reinstatement is ding and keep us informed. \u00a0If you feel worse after the reinstatement, stop it immediately. \u00a0 It's very important that\u00a0you get an accurate and consistent dose. \u00a0The following link tells how to get 1mg of Citalopram. There are several methods described in the link. \u00a0 \u00a0  Tips for tapering off citalopram (Celexa) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

Happy about that! \u00a0 My GP and I have decided to see in April whether we will continue tapering Paxil. That depends on whether I'm stable enough. But I have the feeling that from now on I have the opportunity to let my CNS stabilise.\u00a0 \u00a0 In any way I'm still reading a lot of the materials here. I will definitely use the Brassmonkey slide method. And probably I will incorporate extra weeks to stabilise if need be.",

        "forum_post":"Hi all, \u00a0 I thought I would log in and give an update. I recently listened to one of Alto's video interviews on YouTube and it reminded me of how much help this site has given me. \u00a0 In August 2019, I managed to finish my lithium taper and return to full time work. However, due to a failed relationship and issues at home, I ended up in hospital earlier this year (March) and was put back on lithium and given Abilify.\u00a0 \u00a0 The drugs quickly made me worse and I was unable to function, so my doctor allowed to taper again, and so I did just that and came off all meds by end of July 2020. \u00a0 It's now been about 4 months off medication and I am working again. I have found myself quite down this year in general after my relationship of 7 years broke down. I'm also suffering from obesity and low testosterone, and constantly tired. \u00a0 One of my biggest challenges has been trying to come to terms with how my life has been for the last 20 years. I honesty cannot relate to who I was in the past and I am constantly perplexed by all the drama that took place since being diagnosed and drugged for over 20 years. \u00a0 I am struggling to move on, you could say. I was so sick during the times I was with my partner that I pushed her over the edge with my behaviour and feel like I didn't get a chance to be who I really am. I thought everything would be ok once I am off medication, but unfortunately, it's not. I am left with all the damage from the drugs, a failed relationship, and a tonne of regret regarding all of the past. It's really hard trying to work out what caused what and how much blame I can truly attribute to the medication - I just can't identify with the person of the past anymore. It's like waking up from a coma and trying to work out what the hell happened while I've been out.\u00a0 \u00a0 Making the decision to withdraw from medications 4 years ago has had a huge cost on my life. Not only was it really difficult - as you can see from all my past distressing posts, but it affected my relationship with others (mainly my ex-partner) and especially me. I am still trying to figure out who i am after all these years of experiencing life in lots of different mental states. I guess I could say, the last 20 years of my life in the merry-go-round of psychiatry were traumatic. I feel ripped off.\u00a0 \u00a0 So now, I am just in survival mode whilst grieving what could have been. The physical issues I have from medication (especially the Invega Sustenna LAI) are quite serious and I don't feel like I'll ever be able to be in a relationship again.\u00a0 \u00a0 I feel that psychiatry robbed me of the best years of my life and I don't really feel motivated about the future anymore. I am happy to be off medication finally, but I sometimes can't help but think that I should have never taken this path and lost so much. \u00a0 Sorry for the depressing post, but that's where I am right now.\u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks,Rico\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

I totaled up the number of resources required to do the work and listed it out. I asked her which efforts we are not doing until we get resources.By Tuesday afternoon my manager had named a full-time replacement for the resource who is leaving me on Friday. The new resource is a more highly qualified resource who won't need hand-holding and guidance - I can trust her completely to run with her assignment. In addition, we got a support person to help us with many of the more administrative tasks. It doesn't equal the full set of resources I need, but it puts me in a much better position than I was in before.I chatted with the resource who will be supporting me beginning next week and just felt the stress melt away. This actually works out better for her, too.On the way home tonight I think I actually felt joy again I have 4 more days before I'm at the 4 week point on this decrement. If I continue to feel relieved and have moments of joy, I will decrement by 1 mg. If not, I'll hold a little longer.Karma",

I changed from water titrating my original tablet to water titrating a compounded capsule, and ended up in a three month wave or so. I decided to go back to the the tablet, because it\u2019s more accurate, and did a crossover this time. It went well.\u00a0 \u00a0 This is the formula for the crossover, as ChessieCat mentioned above.\u00a0 \u00a0 3\/4 of the old formula. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01\/4 of the liquid.\u00a0 \u00a0 1\/2 of the old formula. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01\/2 of the liquid.\u00a0 \u00a0 1\/4 of the old formula. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3\/4 of the liquid.\u00a0 \u00a0 You do every stage for 3 days to a week, though I did each stage for more than a week to be safe.\u00a0 \u00a0 I just saw in your signature that you jumped from\u00a0125mg to 25mg in January, and then from 25mg to 12.5mg in February. Is that correct?\u00a0They are huge drops if that\u2019s the case.\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t be doing any tapering as yet until you are stable. I would wait a number of months before I changed anything.\u00a0One should never taper by more than 10% a month, I\u2019m\u00a0tapering just over 3% at the moment.\u00a0 \u00a0 Whatever you do DO NOT jump off at 12.5mg like the doctor suggested, and DO NOT do two changes at the same time.\u00a0 \u00a0 If your doctor doesn\u2019t cooperate with you just try another doctor. Any doctor can give you a script, it doesn\u2019t have to be a psychiatrist. \u00a0 Please be careful, and hold for a while longer. You\u2019ve tapered too quickly, and your brain needs time to stabilise before you change anything else.\u00a0 \u00a0 Sending hugs\ud83e\udd17 \u00a0",

I had a burnout last spring, which really required me to pause my taper and work on my self-care skills. I was unemployed for a while, but now I'm back at work again. \u00a0 I don't know what exactly it is, but I've been having more stress and greater stress responses starting from somewhere around the beginning of the last year... I'm thinking that maybe it's due to me approaching lower doses of olanzapine? Anyone else taking olanzapine \/ Zyprexa experiencing this?I'm also feeling anger more often. And as for the latest drop - I am already feeling low grade anxiety since the drop (which was only 2 days ago!) I'm genuinely interested of how this drop goes. I'm willing to face some anxiety and loss of sleep, but not in excess.I seem to remember people mentioning in this forum that things will become more difficult around the 2.5 mg mark. That might be what this is...Happy (or at least bearable\u00a0\ud83d\ude42) tapering, all!Bokart",

Strange how the body knows if you stay like that, you will die, the strength of the human spirit. \u00a0 \u00a0what a cocktail I was on, post effexor.... \u00a0 and Mirtazipine, the rocket fuel, apparently. \u00a0I reckon the doc supervising me then was good. \u00a0I initially went to him cause I was going to quit effexor, and needed backup, well, how could he tell me what he knew about effexor? \u00a0I was very naive. \u00a0He had no advice to give me,, probably just waiting to collect the pieces from the fallout.\u00a0 \u00a0 I think you are suffering long and hard, post effexor. \u00a0 Please keep posting. \u00a0 My recommendation (as I am neither a doctor, nor anything), is from effexor, go to something else. \u00a0Anything that you can taper. (Not paxil, from what I read).... Zoloft, or another of these drugs \u00a0 \u00a0one that is what I call \"soft one\". \u00a0Short half life, not long half life...... \u00a0 They are all evil, but not as evil as the devils tic tacs \u00a0effexor. \u00a0So taper to another drug, Stay on that for at least two years, then taper the softer drug, very slowly.... \u00a0The two years plus on the other drug, should get you over the worst of the fallout from effexor. \u00a0Is it because I just realised effexor has another initial? \u00a0not just an SSRI? \u00a0probably. \u00a0That last bit it the acronym, changed my personality, and I didnt know it. \u00a0But we all go to these psychs, in despair, usually suffering WD from another drug, as I did. \u00a0Survivial mode, take anything to relieve the pain. \u00a0Thats how they make their money........................... \u00a0we need to keep working, why? \u00a0eventually it catches up with you, and you just cant work. \u00a0Wish I had just stayed in bed, \u00a0that first time, instead of the medicating to \"be normal\". \u00a0Crap. \u00a0Olden days we supported each other emotionally. \u00a0I went to a womens refuge at one stage, on nothing for damn 10 years, so upset \u00a0she said \u00e4h have to get you to a doc real quick\"... \u00a0I bolted, where was the compassion and support. \u00a0Like a quick drug fix will be fine... No such thing. \u00a0 So people out there who felt wonderful, new job, new business... look rationally if you are on effexor... see your accountant. \u00a0is it really making money? \u00a0If you buy a horse and two more dogs, are you just being manic, and adding to your stress, I was. \u00a0Blaming everything on a nasty husband, a horrible bank, nah, they cop some of the blame, but recklessness, if you can get off effexor, and limp onto another drug do it, while you still have some of your old personality, and a bit of money left. \u00a0xx \u00a0 Sorry I am rambling, but am glad I have a record of my journey. \u00a0Thankyou to this website. \u00a0So damn honest.",

I'm really dreading the darkness of Winter, but that's months away, typical of an anxiety sufferer to worry about the future when I should be enjoying the now. \u00a0 The dizziness can be a real nuisance. I ride too, motorcycles not horses, and I've had to give it a miss a good few times due to dizziness. \u00a0 The fog does occasionally lift, I'm hoping it will clear some more as the dose gets lower. \u00a0 That's good that your having windows, it shows you that your brain can and will heal.",

Just go to AccountSettings\/signature and you should be able to add it to your present signature.\u00a0 Make sure and hit the SAVE button after editing there. \u00a0 I think I'll ask @Shep to have a look too.\u00a0 Maybe Shep can offer some suggestions and\/or further information to you around the benzo now. \u00a0 Thanks for the nice inclusion of all your information too, Mocha.\u00a0 And ugh, sorry it's been so rough.\u00a0 Sounds like WD.

Only took 30mgs for two days dropped back and anxiety eased off for awhile but then came back even worse. Dr insisted I go back upto 30mgs as he doesn't believe it is the mirt causing my anxiety. He also told me I could take up my Valium dose to 5mg two-three times a day but have been reluctant to do this as I know it is the mirt causing my anxiety so I have dropped back to 7.5mgs each day which is still causing my anxiety but nowhere near like it was on 15mgs. I will write down what I am doing each day going forward although some days I just panic and feel out of control to do anything. I DO NOT want to go up on my dose or try anymore drugs. Dr has advised I see a psychiatrist but am scared to do so and be given further drugs.  ",

        "forum_post":"That is a kind of harsh statement about the device being a scam, I'd call it more of a \"money printing\" device. \u00a0 Been doing a bit of research on these devices and their FDA status. They are not approved, not any of them. They are only 'cleared'. I'll refer you to the fda.gov site for the fine point description of what that means. FWIW, the drugs you are on, Neil, are all FDA approved but we here know that that approval appears to have been 'bought' by fraud and deception. A quite meaningless term, actually. \u00a0 I decided to research the Alpha Stim first and the odd thing I noted on their site is that all of their 'research' (the 'studies' they have used to back up their claims of its efficacy for helping 'insomnia, depression and anxiety' (the AID), are all self reported. \u00a0 Right there on their homepage is this statement: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Directly below that is a link to the main study, conducted by a \"Professor of Psychometrics and Statistics\", not a lab rat or an MD or anything. \u00a0 Patient self reports are NOT SCIENCE. \u00a0 I got to thinking about the device itself and did a little searching on Alibaba (you ought to go there sometime and see where all of the cheap asian electronic crap we buy is offered for import and sale). It is right on their (Alpha Stim) site that the device is made in china. Look for a device called \"happy sleep\" and you will see that it is half the cost of the stim device and looks suspiciously like the same thing (the ear clips, the pads, the inscrutable icons on the face of it). \u00a0 Also check out a site called 'ces4me'. Probably the very same device but closer to the asian import price. (I'll bet they got a better deal with an asian manufacturer and will be printing money at a faster rate, maybe). \u00a0 I am not wanting to rain on anyone's parade but we can be so gullible when it comes to 'need' and 'want'. I am a little bleary eyed from so much reading but I hope to add something to the topic in symptoms about a 2014 study just completed that had a few words in it on how these devices 'might' work. It is a real stretch at best. The Alpha Stim site has a fancy graphic containing a lot of fancy words such as 'raphe nuclei', 5HT, serotonin: all the buzzwords the pharma rats bamboozled our docs (and us) with to get us to take their crappy drugs. \u00a0 The terrible thing is, the drugs DO work, after a fashion. But what they do (and how they do it) is dangerous and criminal. And destroys a lot of perfectly good people in the process. \u00a0 Neil, put your drugs into the drugs interaction checker at drugs.com and see what your docs have been doing to you. Your drug combination is dangerous. You will need to very carefully taper off ALL those drugs and it will take years and you might then find yourself to be an entirely different person. A person who probably did not need all those drugs to begin with. Most of them actually can cause depression. \u00a0 For the record, just list the ones you are on now in your signature and mention how long you've been on the drug carousel and include the ECT too. Just a short blurb will do. You are among friends here, and don't be surprised at the comments you'll get on your thread. I (and some others) are in the 'anger' phase at how badly we were misled by all the pharma hype and we've been through the hard horrible wringer of withdrawal and are still recovering. To see you wanting to embrace an expensive (and probably ineffective) device so eagerly makes me want to cry. \u00a0 Don't you dare stop taking any of those drugs suddenly, read the links you were given about how to reduce them safely. You'll be glad you did. You won't want to cold turkey off 120 mg cymbalta like I did, I am lucky I did not die. That was in the beginning, the real withdrawal did not hit until a year later. That is a hell I'd like to reserve for the people who invented and marketed this crap and keep pushing it on an unsuspecting public. \u00a0 You found SA because you saw a link to the CES device. Please stay and get educated on the REST of the story. \u00a0 (PS. I am not mean, I always talk this way. And I purposely left out links to stuff. Learning how to use google is a good thing.)",

Any of the following signs and symptoms may be caused by any of the medications in the lists below, alone or in combination, as well as by other medications not listed here that have anticholinergic properties. This table is provided because: 1) Medications in many categories have anticholinergic properties; 2) The use of multiple medications with such properties may be particularly problematic because of the cumulative effects; and 3) Anticholinergic side effects are particularly common and problematic, especially in the older individual61, 62.

        "forum_post":"nystumbleweed -- Welcome to Surviving Antidepressants (SA) \u00a0 I'm sorry you've needed to find your way here but am glad that you did find us and post. Thanks for creating and posting a signature. \u00a0 It's possible that what you experienced as the \"Valium no longer helping\" was withdrawal from Prozac.\u00a0 Our esteemed friend and SA member, nz11, has given you a link to a topic with good information about symptoms that arise during SSRI withdrawal. \u00a0 Here are two links that helped me understand what is happening during withdrawal as the CNS (central nervous system) adjusts to the changes in dosage: How your brain responds to psychiatric drugs - aka \"Brain remodeling\" Youtube video, 3 min 44 sec: Healing from antidepressants \u00a0 Skipping days of neuro-psychoactive drugs, such as you're doing with Valium, can set the stage for problems. What are your thoughts about returning to a consistent daily dose? You may want to read our discussion topic on the Ashton manual about safe discontinuation. There are other relevant topics pinned to the top of our Members-only forum focused on benzo medications. \u00a0 For reference, here are topics relevant to your situation: Tips for tapering off Prozac (fluoxetine) Tips for tapering off trazodone (Desyrel) \u00a0 Are you open to reinstating a very small dose of Prozac? Please note this is a question about willingness, not a suggestion to do so. If you are willing to test it, someone on the moderating team will suggest a dose for your consideration. \u00a0  Reinstatement is most effective soon after the last dose; as time passes since the last dose, the likelihood of it being effective decreases and the risk of worsening symptoms increases. That said, there are members here at SA who have reinstated successfully 6 months and more after their last dose.\u00a0 Aside from reinstatement, time is the only other known \"cure\" for w\/d symptoms.  \u00a0 For more detail, please read About reinstating and stabilizing to reduce withdrawal symptoms A tip: You may way want to follow this topic so that you get notifications when someone posts in your thread. Click the gray \"Follow this topic\" button. A dialog box appears: select one of the notify options, then click follow this topic in the dialog box. \u00a0 \u00a0 I've given you lots to read. Have a look at the linked topics. If you have questions, please post them here in your introduction so that all your information stays in one place.",

        "forum_post":"Hello everyone!\u00a0 \u00a0 I have PDA (Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia) since 15 and \u00a0I\u00b4m in drugs since there (now I\u00b4m 31). I tried different medications, but I think I\u00b4m with venlafaxin and clonazepam for about ten years (clonazepam since the begining of the treatment).\u00a0 \u00a0 I have always responded well to medical treatments overall. Sometimes I was great, sometimes I was ok, but never in that big hole of being trapped in you own home again. Never had major colateral effects.\u00a0 \u00a0 My life became almost normal, thanks god. I married, had a good job and socialize. I just avoided some situations, like being all bymyself in a distant place, for example (mild agorafobia) \u00a0 At July 2015, after doing my first international trip I decided I was \"cured\" and started to withdrawn the medication. My start point was 75mg of venlafaxin and 1,0 mg of clonazepam (It wasn\u00b4t my higher dose, but the one I stabilized) \u00a0 I didn\u00b4t knew the 10% rule, but somehow I instinctly followed it . I made it really slow and without any visible sympton. In the beginning I discontinued it a little bit faster. \u00a0 In january 2016 (six months later) I was taking half of the medication without any sympton (37,5mg\/0,5mg) \u00a0 I continued tappering slowly. From january 2016 to december 2016 I cutted another half (37,5 day yes, day no\/0,25) \u00a0 The problem was that with that dose I started to have some panic attacks. My main symptons are: shortness of breath, derealization (which I never had in this way) and weakness overall.\u00a0  \u00a0 Six months ago I was playing soccer for two hours, now I\u00b4m having trouble walking for 10 minutes.\u00a0  \u00a0 So, resuming: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Venlafaxin \u00a0 Clonazepam \u00a0 July 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 75mg \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1mg \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (feeling great)\u00a0  January 2016 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 37,5mg \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00,5mg \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(feeling great)\u00a0  January 2017 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 18mg \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0,25 mg \u00a0 (having panic attacks)\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Until now I\u00b4m dealing with my attacks and learning some CBT tools to fight against. I have some questions and count on your help!\u00a0 \u00a0 1. Is there any problem taking the venflaxin day yes\/day no or is better to dissolve it and start to take it 18mg\/day?\u00a0 \u00a0 2. It\u00b4s ok to tapper the two meds at once? If not, which one would be the best to start? \u00a0 3. I think that my symptons are not from tappering fast, I think it\u00b4s really my anxiety\/panic condition that was covered by the meds, what is your experience? What do you think? \u00a0 4. If I return to my safe point (37,5\/0,5) is there any garantee that I will fell better again or there is a high risk of returning to a higher dose and continue feeling bad? I could tapper it even slowly in next time with more help (now I know this site and I\u00b4m reading it a lot) \u00a0 5. If there\u00b4s a high chance to return feeling good taking this dose, in how many time can I expect the effects of the reintroduction of the meds?\u00a0Obs.: I have a major important admission exam in less than 2 months and that\u00b4s my real thing. If wasn\u00b4t for it, I would hold up hands down. But my fear is that it mess up my studying and my performance. \u00a0 6. Anything you want to comment will help.\u00a0 \u00a0 *Congratulations for all the comunity, I hope I can add some experience with the meds, the tappering and the disease itself. **I started do read some material, but it\u00b4s a lot of thing, so, I\u00b4m sorry if I ask something that is already written. ***Hope you compreend my english, I\u00b4m not practicing it for a while.",

I thought any second the cortisol\/ adrenalin would flood my system but it didn't happen, felt amazing! \u00a0I have drastically changed my diet\u2026low carb, no sugar, no processed crap, no alcohol and high fats including Coconut oil, MCT oil, grass-fed butter coupled with a light exercise regime and I think the CNS loves this style and rewarded me with a little caffeine tolerance\u00a0  . \u00a0When things were s&*% a few weeks back, I was really strict with the above and added heart math and other meditation techniques everyday and things evened out. \u00a0The drops had caught up with me and decided to give me a swift smack upside the head. \u00a0\"Ok I get it, I will slow down a little!\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Secondly, for the benzo sufferers\u2026. \u00a0 Last week marks 1 year out from Klonipin and I can honestly say, based on where I was a year prior, I have healed exponentially. \u00a0I chose to use Remeron to ease this withdrawal and am paying the price for it now, but, I would say, 90% of the horrible symptoms are gone. \u00a0I am fully functional, returned to work a long time ago and doing pretty darn well considering. \u00a0Yes, I have setbacks and have grown accustomed to those annoying floaters but compared to tolerance withdrawal (6 months) and acute withdrawal, not even close. \u00a0I had all of the horrid symptoms and most of them resolved\u2026gone!! \u00a0 \u00a0 So keep pushing, keep fighting\u2026try to find the stability that your CNS and brain require and go slow. \u00a0If your sleep deprived, withdrawal rattled brain wants to change things rapidly to fix your situation\u2026..read the KISS post on this site, take a breath and wait it out\u2026.if that means a longer hold or slowing taper down..try to do it. \u00a0I laugh when I look at my previous posts where I was desperate\u2026thankfully the support was here to help show me the way. \u00a0I am eternally grateful for that. \u00a0Everyone of us on this site who continue to fight have my deepest respect, you are heroes, don't forget that. \u00a0 Take care \u00a0 BB",

The following is a quote i found on this site. \u00a0 \"My guess is: The first phase of withdrawal, the acute phase, is the initial shock of withdrawal, with the most defined symptoms, such as brain zaps and nausea and possibly waves of unusually intense \"depression\" and \"anxiety\" -- actually, emotions generated by the neurological upset. Later, glutamatergic hyper-reactivity and autonomic instability take over. Often the autonomic instability causes wide hypersensitivity to drugs, supplements, and even foods.\" \u00a0 My question and also some of my observation of my case is; does anyobe think it is possible or probable that someone can experience both at the same time? The reason i say this is because since my taper started and more so since my 5 month hold on a dose my symptoms have been different at different stages. Leading up to my last dosage reduction 10 days ago, my symptoms were mainly anxiety\/aggitation and fatigue\/flat along with apathy. In the last few days of this reduction my symptoms are more head orientated like crushing headaches and tension around temples etc. Is it possible or probable that as one tapers they can experience both accute and Paws?",

To me weed was the unlimited sleep aid, always went to bed stoned. When I\u2019d try to stop over the years I couldn\u2019t sleep and I\u2019d go back to it and give up.\u00a0\u00a0 I ended up going to rehab in 2012 but at that time I also drank. Anyway, because I couldn\u2019t sleep in rehab ( at all ) they\u00a0put me on trazadone and I\u2019ve taken it since. I\u2019ve been sober since 2012.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0My main point is that many people who smoke weed for years have sleep issues when they stop.

I can remember when I first joined SA. I really wondered if I was going to make it. Just getting from one moment to the next was so difficult. I made it though and if not for having to taper from benzos I would probably be back to my regular life. I'm still getting occasional waves but I don't know if that's from the CT or the continued injury to my brain from tapering my clonazepam. I'm lucky though, my pdoc lets me taper at my own rate and hold when I need to. It has made a huge difference for me. I started coming out of the severe withdrawals around the middle of May last year. I've had some pretty severe waves since then but most of the time things are good. I'm tapering my benzo so slowly that I'm pretty much functional most of the time. Unfortunately hormones can throw things into a mess and deliver me into a wave but even though it's still really hard to deal with a wave I do know that it will pass and that knowledge really helps. \u00a0 I hope all are doing well. \u00a0 Healing and hugs, \u00a0 T",

I am just simply using my intelligence to understand these drugs, and make it undrstandable to other lay people like myself.  I really have no training in science or math beyond high school. ( I have a college degree, but in the arts.) \u00a0 I think my reasoning here makes good common sense and is a reasonable guideline to follow.  I don't need to get any more technical about Effexor and the word \"effective\".  I think the average user will know what I mean.  Obviously those, who had a bad reaction and couldn't tolerate Effexor, would not consider using it to switch from Pristiq.  And those who've been on Effexor before, and found that it helped them somewhat, with tolerable side effects, but with some improvement in their depression or whatever it was prescribed for, then they know that it would be safe to go back to Effexor. \u00a0 Also, many doctors do use Prozac as a bridge, even though its an SSRI. Pristiq's function as an SNRI is not that strong. It's a 14:1 ratio of Serotonin to Norepinephrine.  Supplementing with L-Tyrosine which the body converts to Norepinephrine might be good when switching to Prozac.  It might be a better option for some people than going on Effexor either because they had a bad reaction to it in the first place or don't really know how they will react. \u00a0 Unfortunately, it seems with any of the options, it is impossible to escape some side effects.  Ultimately, using your gut feeling about what is the best option for you, knowing your body, and hopefully working with a knowledgeable doctor will help.  Sadly, most of us wind up playing guinea pigs with our own bodies, and suffering as a result.   \u00a0 Good luck to you all and wishing you successful tapers and freedom from pharmaceuticals!",

Within about six weeks I felt a huge improvement in my cognition and libido. \u00a0 In April 2020 I stopped using Seroxat (Paxil) after fifteen years and I have a series of blood tests which showed my E2 (oestrogen) levels going crazy for a period of about four months. By comparison, my testosterone levels held fairly stable but my E2 was all over the place.\u00a0 At the time, I was in the middle of Paxil WD symptoms and felt I had enough going on without paying too much attention to my hormone levels. It's only now though that I wonder\/suspect if these fluctuating values magnified my WD symptoms, and if these fluctuations were a result of stopping Paxil. \u00a0 I've since switched to testosterone cypionate injections and now that my WD symptoms have eased off enough, I've started to pay attention to my hormone blood test results again. I feel at my best when both my testosterone and E2 levels are in the higher range of normal (29.20nmol\/L and 214pmol\/L respectively). This is purely my own opinion (I'm an engineer, not a doctor), but I feel that E2 is more important than testosterone when it comes to libido.

I've actually just terrifyingly realised my bad reaction trying to go back on Citalopram in December was actually\u00a0 severe akathisia, the pacing, couldn't stay still, lie in bed, increased anxiety that never lets up. I've just now realised I must be in the withdrawl version of akathisia as I can't sit still like I used to, I get this build up of feeling really uncomfortable and have to stand up and go into the kitchen or something then I go back to my seat. I've also noticed my abdomen keeps contracting. I pray it's not that and I'm just highly adgitated. If it is that, then going back on Citalopram is out of the question. I'm not sure what to do, I can't even find a doctor to discuss this with in the UK. So sick of being afraid all the time.",

        "forum_post":"Hi there! I was wondering if there are any other doctors\/med students in withdrawal? I work as a doctor already, but I'm not graduated yet, so I'm in the last phases of med school. Just looking for people like me. \u00a0 To put it in brief, I have been on Lexapro for 8 years of which last tapering, currently at 1mg for 8 weeks. When I was put on drugs in the first place, I was 23 and had relationship drama and existential crisis what to do in life etc. Used to be the happiest of kids. So I have been eating Lexapro 10 mg for years without anybody ever thinking to get me off even though my life situation completely changed. Only benzos for myoclonus and tsopiclone for sleeping were suggested, but I never took them. I had done some minibreaks form Lex, but I didn't realize I was hooked, since when the first withdrawal sypmtoms came, I thought I am still depressed and reinitiated. CTd 6\/2017 as I was abroad couldn't get an easy hold of drugs. In 2 months was in severe anxiety and insomnia without any reason in my life and realized I'm addicted. Reinitiated at 10mg and got seizures for every night as I didn't tolerate the drug any more. Cut to 5 and got rid of the seizures and been tapering ever since. So for a year now been tapering. It's been the hardest thing in my life, but it's my whole future life at stake so not turning back, not giving up. And been able to continue my life quite normally all this time. \u00a0 So to other doctors\/med students out there: Wondering, how have you experienced this betrayal from your own field of expertise? I myself have become so much more critical about drugs and medical interventions in general, when I have realized, how I was mislead myself in this case. It is tricky because if you want to be able to work, you have to trust the best practice guidelines in your country as it is not possible for every doctor to check the references for all the stuff. However for example in psychiatry you can't trust these guidelines obviously. Also feel really bad, when see patients at hospitals clearly distroyed by psych meds: having movement disorders, akathisia and stuff... \u00a0 In a way I guess, as a doctor, it has been sort of faster for me to realize that I can't trust my psychiatrist and take the lead myself. Even though also for me it was only, when I CTd.\u00a0 Before that I did indeed eat those 7 years this ****..\u00a0 Anyways I guess for someone who trusts the doctor to have more knowledge than herself it takes more time to see that expert has no clue. I soon realized that the clinical trials for SSRIs were 8 weeks long, so these experts don't actually know anything about long-term use and I am on my own getting clean. Anyways looking for people like me out there:) Wish you all the best of luck and strength in this process. I am happy myself I am already at 1 mg even though some symptoms still remaining. But I'm pretty confident I get there and still feel\/hope the permanent damage isn't really bad for me:)",

I think that from now on I will take that first dose when the alarm goes off at 5 am. making the 2nd dose at 11 am hoping that the morning will be more smooth that way. \u00a0 The lex drop has been stable . I won't attempt another drop until finding and then maintaining  a strict routine of 1 mg every 6 hrs. with the xanax. \u00a0 I will be looking for advice to the contrary of tapering the lex next and instead  attempting a drop of the xanax since it seems to be the drug that has been making me feel the worst.  But I will listen to advice.  \u00a0 I will report back periodically to journal the xanax dosing and results..... for now all I can say is that I had a SUPER week and I was only called a bit@h once!",
